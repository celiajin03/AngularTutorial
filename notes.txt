Decoratorï¼ša function which we use to attach meta data to a class, method, accessor, property, or parameter.
           And we apply it using the @expression. For example: @component, @injectable

@NgModule is a decorator that defines the class as an angular module and adds the required metadata to it.

@injectable has two purposes:
	One is it instructs angular that this class needs a dependency.
	Using the providedIn we inform the dependency injection system how to provide the service.
